async function mineCobblestone(bot) {
    // The function is about mining cobblestone blocks until you have at least 3 cobblestone in your inventory. If you already have cobblestone, the function does nothing. If you don't have enough cobblestone, it calls the `mineBlock` function to mine stone blocks until you have the desired amount of cobblestone. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that 3 cobblestone have been mined.
