async function mineCoalOre(bot) {
    // The function is about mining coal ore blocks until the bot has obtained enough coal. First, it checks if the bot already has enough coal in its inventory. If it does, it sends a chat message and returns. If not, it mines coal ore blocks until it has obtained the desired amount of coal. Once the task is complete, it sends a chat message indicating that it has mined the required amount of coal ore.
